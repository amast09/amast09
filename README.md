### Hi there, my name is Aaron and I am a remote software engineer. ðŸ‘‹

I am a product focused, pragmatic and passionate engineer. I take pride in
writing well tested, flexible, extensible, and performant software.

I love learning new things, writing tests, and building stuff.

In my spare time I enjoy distance running, watching college football and going
to the beach with my dog.

Checkout some of the projects/apps I have built.
